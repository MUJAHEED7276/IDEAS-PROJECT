An important aspect of teaching is to engage students in the learning process.  Evidence  has shown that the use of technology to increase engagement and participation of students in the classroom is important.  The use of technology in a high school mathematics classroom to engage students was investigated in this study.  The purpose was to determine if the use of  student response systems or clickers in the classroom engaged more students than a classroom not using the technology.  The second part of this study was to investigate whether the use of this technology increased student test scores.  This study took place in a high school mathematics class during the 2018-2019 school year, in Bilyaminu Usman Polytechnic Hadejia.  The study involved data gathered from classroom observations, student surveys, student interviews, quiz and test results, and the teacher`s journal.
